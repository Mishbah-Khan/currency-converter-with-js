Currency Converter â€“ Practice Project

This is a simple Currency Converter application built using raw JavaScript (vanilla JS). The primary goal of this project was to practice and strengthen my JavaScript skills by working on real-world functionality without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

The app allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using live exchange rates fetched from an external API. It includes features such as:

Dynamic dropdowns for selecting currencies

Asynchronous API calls using fetch()

Real-time conversion results

This project is focused purely on JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation, making it a valuable exercise in mastering core JavaScript concepts.
